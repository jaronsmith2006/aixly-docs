## Shopify integration (merchant view)

This app integrates with Shopify in a few key places:

### 1) Theme App Embed (storefront)

To show the widget on your storefront, you enable the app embed in your theme:

- **Online Store → Themes → Customize → App embeds**

### 2) Orders and customer support workflows

The assistant can help customers with order-related questions and capture “Order requests” you can manage in the app.

### 3) Billing

Plans and billing run through Shopify’s standard subscription flow, and (if applicable) usage charges appear in Shopify billing.
