## Welcome

This `docs/` directory is intended to be copied into a **separate Docusaurus repo** and published as a merchant help center.

### What’s inside

- `getting-started/`: install + go-live setup for merchants
- `features/`: how to use each admin feature (Appearance, Settings, Chats, Requests, Analytics, Plans)
- `integrations/`: merchant-facing integration docs (Shopify + future channels)
- `troubleshooting/`: common issues merchants hit
- `faq.md`: merchant FAQ (non-technical)
- `changelog.md`: customer-facing change log

### Docusaurus notes

- Each doc uses frontmatter (`title`, `sidebar_position`) compatible with Docusaurus.
- Folder ordering/labels can be controlled via `_category_.json`.
