## Where to find it

- In the app, open **Appearance → Popups**

---

## Popup types

You can enable:

- **Greeting on load**: a friendly prompt when the widget loads
- **Idle popup**: a prompt if the visitor hasn’t interacted
- **Promotion popup**: show an offer (coupon, sale, announcement)

Best practice:

- Keep popups short and helpful.
- Avoid showing promotions too aggressively (it can reduce trust).

---

## Proactive engagement

You can also show a proactive prompt after a visitor has been browsing for a while:

- Enable **Proactive prompt**
- Set “Show after (seconds)” (recommended: 20–40 seconds)
- Optionally limit to “Only once per 30-minute session”
