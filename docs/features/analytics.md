## Where to find it

- In the app, open **Analytics**

## What you can measure

- Conversations and trends
- Escalations (handed to a human)
- Engagement funnel (widget loads → opens → messages → product clicks → add to cart)
- Revenue attribution (orders influenced by chat, if enabled)
- Usage charges (if your plan includes overage billing)

## How to use analytics effectively

- If conversations are high but product clicks are low:
  - improve quick actions
  - adjust the first message to invite product discovery
- If complaints are high:
  - add more policy URLs and manual FAQs
  - refine assistant tone for more empathy
